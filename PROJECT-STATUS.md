    - LoginScreen             (Invitation branding, single form, auto-create/login)
    - Hamburger Sidebar       (Navigation: Welcome, Sources, Enrich, Results, Skills, Configuration, Branding (workspace only), theme toggle -- all always clickable)
    - CompanyInfoModal        (Partner information form - 8 fields, creates client on save)
    - UploadScreen            (3-step journey with founder quotes, Step 2 links to Sources)
    - SourcesScreen           (Source Library + Add Sources — file CRUD, toggle, replace, delete)

  index.css        -- Global styles and theme tokens
  main.jsx         -- React entry point
```

### Five-Screen Flow

1. **Welcome / Upload Screen** (3-step journey layout with founder testimonials)
   - Header: Hamburger menu (left), XO logo, title, Intellagentic logo (right)
   - Step 1: Domain Expertise -- inline Organization Profile form (name, website w/ link icon, industry, current business description, future plans, multi-entry pain points, contacts, addresses)
   - Step 2: Raw Data -- Compact source count summary with "Manage Sources" link (or "Add Sources" if empty)
     - Sources managed on dedicated Sources screen (see below)
   - Step 3: Intelligent Growth -- Preview of analysis output (grayed until steps 1&2 complete)
   - "Continue to Enrichment" button (replaces "Upload & Continue" — files already uploaded via Sources)

2. **Sources Screen** (NotebookLM-style Source Library)
   - **Top panel — Source Library**: File list with card rows, summary bar (X active · Y total · Z MB)
     - Each card: file type icon, filename, version badge (v2/v3), source pill (Local red / Google Drive blue), file size, date
     - Active/inactive toggle (ToggleLeft/ToggleRight) — dims inactive cards
     - Kebab menu (MoreVertical): Replace, Delete
     - Delete confirmation modal overlay
     - Replace triggers file picker, creates new version with parent_upload_id link
     - Empty state matching Skills screen pattern
   - **Bottom panel — Add Sources**: Drag-and-drop zone with immediate upload on drop
     - Sources strip: Upload (active), Google Drive (OAuth popup), NotebookLM/Dropbox/OneDrive (grayed out)
     - Google Drive file picker modal (moved from UploadScreen)
     - Pending files list with progress indicators
   - Requires clientId (shows "Complete Domain Expertise first" message if missing)
   - Action Buttons Row: Configurable buttons between step cards and quotes (Enrich, Skills by default)
     - Clickable: internal routes navigate, external URLs open in new tab
     - Managed via Configuration screen, rendered with hex colors and glow shadows
   - Founder Quotes: Two editorial pull quotes side-by-side (Alan Moore & Ken Scott)
   - Compact layout: All steps + quotes fit on screen without scrolling (220px card height)

2. **Enrich Screen**
   - Model badge shows current AI model (purple for Opus, blue for Sonnet)
   - "Start Enrichment" button triggers /enrich Lambda with selected model
   - Real-time progress tracking (5 stages: extract, transcribe, research, analyze, complete)
   - Lambda reads skills from S3 and injects into Claude prompt
   - Auto-navigates to results when complete

3. **Results Screen**
   - Executive Summary
   - Problems Identified (expandable cards with severity badges)
   - Proposed Data Schema (expandable tables with column details)
   - 7/14/21 Day Action Plan
   - Data Sources (client data, web enrichment, AI analysis)

4. **Skills Screen** (new)
   - List of domain-specific skills (markdown files from S3)
   - "+ Add Skill" button opens modal
   - Modal: skill name, markdown content (monospace textarea), or upload .md file
   - Each skill can be edited or deleted
   - Skills injected into Claude prompt during enrichment
   - Empty state: "No skills yet. Add your first skill to enhance AI analysis."

5. **Configuration Screen** (fully functional)
   - **AI Model selector**: Radio-button cards for Claude Opus 4.5 (default) and Sonnet 4.5
     - Selection saved per-user to PostgreSQL via PUT /auth/preferences
     - Opus card: purple accent, "Best analysis quality" description
     - Sonnet card: blue accent, "Faster responses, lower cost" description
   - Theme toggle: working light/dark mode with localStorage persistence
   - Configure Buttons: Surgical Trays reference pattern with drag-and-drop reorder
     - Each button card: grip handle, colored icon circle, name, color/icon label, URL, edit/copy/delete icons
     - Inline editing: label, URL, 8-color grid selector with checkmarks, icon grid (30+ icons)
     - "+ Add Button" creates new button and opens inline editor
   - Live Preview: right-side panel renders buttons exactly as they appear on Welcome page
   - Buttons stored in PostgreSQL via /buttons API, synced on login and save
   - Action buttons on Welcome page are clickable:
     - Internal routes (/enrich, /skills, etc.) navigate to that screen
     - External URLs (https://...) open in new tab

### CSS Architecture

**Theme:** Dark header (#1a1a2e), light/dark body via CSS variables, red accent (#dc2626)

**Theme System (CSS Variables):**
- `:root` (light): --bg-body: #f0f0f0, --bg-card: #ffffff, --text-primary: #1a1a1a
- `[data-theme="dark"]`: --bg-body: #0d1117, --bg-card: #161b22, --text-primary: #c9d1d9
- Variables cover: body, cards, inputs, borders, text, shadows, scrollbar
- Theme persisted to localStorage (key: xo-theme), applied via data-theme attribute on body
- Toggle accessible from Configuration screen and hamburger sidebar

**Key Styles:**
- Dark cards with numbered step circles (48px) - compact 220px height
- Horizontal layout: 3 cards in one row, tightly spaced (0.75rem gap)
- Founder quotes: Editorial pull quotes with 3.5rem red quotation marks
- Hamburger sidebar: 280px width, slide-out from left with dark background
- All content fits on screen without scrolling (standard laptop viewport)
- Mobile responsive: cards and quotes stack vertically at <768px
- Mobile header: "XO Capture" swaps to "Rapid Prototype" at ≤768px, version badge hidden
- Touch-friendly buttons: min 44px height
- Modal: full-width on mobile with scrollable body
- Button config cards: slideIn/fadeIn animations, card-hover/btn-hover transitions

## API ENDPOINTS

**Authentication:** All endpoints except POST /auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/reset-password, and POST /invite require a JWT Bearer token in the Authorization header.

### POST /auth/login

**Purpose:** Authenticate user and return JWT token. **Auto-creates account** if email doesn't exist.
**Lambda:** xo-auth

**Behavior:**
- If email exists → verify password with bcrypt → return JWT (200)
- If email doesn't exist → create account (name derived from email) → return JWT (201)
- Password must be at least 8 characters for new accounts

**Request:**
```json
{
  "email": "ken.scott@intellagentic.io",
  "password": "XOquickstart2026!"
}
```

**Response (200 existing user / 201 new user):**
```json
{

## LAMBDA FUNCTIONS

All Lambdas require JWT auth (except /auth/login). Auth is provided by `auth_helper.py` (shared module copied into each deploy package). All Lambdas use the `xo-psycopg2` Lambda layer for PostgreSQL, JWT, and bcrypt support. 7 Lambdas total.

**Common Environment Variables (all Lambdas):**
- BUCKET_NAME: xo-client-data
- DATABASE_URL: postgresql://xo_admin:PASSWORD@HOST:5432/xo_quickstart
- JWT_SECRET: (256-bit random secret)

### xo-auth

**Runtime:** Python 3.11
**Memory:** 256 MB
**Timeout:** 30 seconds
**Handler:** lambda_function.lambda_handler

**What it does:**
1. Routes by path: /auth/google, /auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/reset-password, /auth/preferences
2. POST /auth/google: **Google OAuth login** -- verify ID token via Google tokeninfo endpoint, check email against ALLOWED_EMAILS list (4 admin emails), upsert user (sentinel password_hash blocks password login), return JWT with `is_admin=true`
3. POST /auth/login: **Auto-create flow** -- if email exists, verify bcrypt password; if not, create new user (is_admin=false)
4. POST /auth/register: Explicit registration with optional name field
5. POST /auth/reset-password: Updates bcrypt hash directly (prototype, no email verification)
6. PUT /auth/preferences: Update user preferences (preferred_model) -- requires JWT auth
7. Returns JWT (24h expiry, HS256) with user_id, email, name, is_admin
8. Login response includes preferred_model + is_admin flag
9. Name auto-derived from email prefix for auto-created accounts (e.g., ken.scott → Ken Scott)

**Admin Emails (ALLOWED_EMAILS):** alan.moore@intellagentic.io, ken.scott@intellagentic.io, rs@multiversant.com, vn@multiversant.com
**Env Vars:** DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, BUCKET_NAME, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID

**File:** backend/lambdas/auth/lambda_function.py

    - White form card on #f5f5f5 background, red focus states on inputs
    - **Auto-create backend**: /auth/login now creates accounts automatically if email doesn't exist
    - New account names derived from email prefix (ken.scott → Ken Scott)
    - Existing users: bcrypt password verification as before
    - **New API endpoints**: POST /auth/register (explicit), POST /auth/reset-password (prototype)
    - API Gateway routes added for /auth/register and /auth/reset-password
    - Lambda permissions configured for all new routes
    - Seed admin email updated to ken.scott@intellagentic.io across all files
    - Frontend build: ~215 KB JS (reduced from ~220 KB by removing mode switching code)

33. **Google Drive Connector** (Session 7 - February 28, 2026)
    - **New Lambda: xo-gdrive-import** (Python 3.11, 512 MB, 120s timeout)
    - 4 routes: GET /gdrive/auth-url, POST /gdrive/callback, GET /gdrive/files, POST /gdrive/import
    - **Google OAuth2 popup flow**: consent URL → popup → redirect → code exchange → refresh token stored in DB
    - Dependencies: google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-api-python-client
    - Google Docs auto-export: Docs/Slides→PDF, Sheets→CSV
    - **DB migration**: 3 new columns (users.google_drive_refresh_token, users.google_drive_connected_at, uploads.source)
    - uploads.source defaults to 'manual', Google Drive imports recorded as 'google_drive'
    - **Frontend Sources strip**: 5 connector pills below drop zone (Upload, Google Drive, NotebookLM, Dropbox, OneDrive)
    - Upload and Google Drive are active connectors; NotebookLM, Dropbox, OneDrive grayed out (future)
    - **Google Drive file picker modal**: dark modal with folder navigation, file selection, import button
    - Folder navigation with back button and breadcrumb stack
    - File count display updated: "3 files selected (1 from Drive)"
    - Upload logic updated: manual files get presigned URLs, imported files skip S3 PUT (already in S3)
    - API Gateway: 4 new routes with OPTIONS, AWS_PROXY integration, Lambda invoke permission
    - Deploy scripts updated: set-db-config.sh (7 Lambdas), deploy.sh notes
    - Frontend build: ~224 KB JS
    - Files: 7 files created/modified

34. **Session Persistence Fix** (Session 8 - March 1, 2026)
    - **Root cause**: `isTokenExpired()` used `atob()` which can fail on JWT URL-safe base64 (`-` and `_` chars)
    - When `atob()` threw, catch block returned `true` (expired) → session silently cleared on restore
    - **Fix 1**: `isTokenExpired()` now converts URL-safe base64 to standard (`-`→`+`, `_`→`/`) and adds padding before `atob()`
    - **Fix 2**: Session restore moved from `useEffect` (async, after first render) to synchronous `useState` initializer
    - Old behavior: App always rendered LoginScreen first, then useEffect restored session on next tick → flash of login screen
    - New behavior: `getInitialAuth()` reads localStorage synchronously before first render → no flash, no race condition
    - `getInitialAuth()` wrapped in try/catch for JSON parse and localStorage errors → graceful fallback to logged-out state
    - Debug confirmed: backend `/auth/login` returns valid tokens, `getAuthHeaders()` sends Bearer token correctly
    - Deployed to production via CloudFront invalidation

35. **Model Selector + Opus Default** (Session 8 - March 1, 2026)
    - **AI Model selector** in Configuration screen: radio-button cards for Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5
    - Opus 4.5 is default (best analysis quality); Sonnet 4.5 available (faster, cheaper)
    - Per-user preference stored in PostgreSQL (`users.preferred_model` column)
    - **DB migration**: `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN preferred_model VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'claude-opus-4-5-20250529'`
    - **New API route**: PUT /auth/preferences (validates model against allowed list, updates DB)
    - **xo-auth Lambda updated**: login response includes `preferred_model`, new `handle_preferences` endpoint
    - **xo-enrich Lambda updated**: reads model from request body → user DB preference → default Opus
      - `analyze_with_claude()` now accepts `model` parameter
      - Lambda timeout increased from 120s to 300s (5 minutes) for Opus response times
    - **Frontend**: model selector with purple (Opus) and blue (Sonnet) accent cards
    - **Enrich screen**: model badge in header (purple "Opus 4.5" / blue "Sonnet 4.5")
    - **EnrichScreen** sends `model: preferredModel` in /enrich request body
    - API Gateway: /auth/preferences resource with PUT + OPTIONS, Lambda invoke permissions
    - Frontend build: ~226 KB JS
    - Deployed: xo-auth Lambda, xo-enrich Lambda, frontend, CloudFront invalidation

36. **Audio Transcription + Context Metadata** (Session 9 - March 1, 2026)
    - **AWS Transcribe integration** for MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG, FLAC, WMA files
    - Audio files now transcribed during enrichment and included in Claude analysis
    - **Async Lambda pattern**: xo-enrich refactored to two-phase execution
      - Phase 1 (synchronous, <2s): auth, validate, create enrichment record, self-invoke async → return immediately
      - Phase 2 (async invocation): extract text → transcribe audio → analyze with Claude → write results
      - Fixes API Gateway 29-second timeout for large enrichments
    - **Stage tracking**: new `enrichments.stage` DB column (extracting → transcribing → researching → analyzing → complete)
      - xo-results Lambda returns `stage` in polling response
      - Frontend stage tracker already wired (5 stages with icons including "Transcribing Audio")
    - **Transcription pipeline**: `find_audio_files()` → `transcribe_single_file()` (poll every 5s, max 240s) → `read_transcribe_output()`
    - Transcripts saved to `{client_id}/extracted/{filename}.transcript.txt`
    - Raw Transcribe output saved to `{client_id}/extracted/.transcribe-output/{filename}.json`
    - **Audio context metadata**: per-audio-file context form in upload screen
      - Date of recording (date picker, defaults to today)
      - Participants (text field, e.g., "Ken Scott, Alan Moore")
      - Context/Topic (text field, e.g., "Weekly strategy call")
      - Saved as `{filename}.context.json` alongside audio in S3 uploads folder
    - **Context-aware transcripts**: enrich Lambda reads context JSON and prepends to each transcript:
      `"Audio Transcript (file.mp3) -- Date: 2026-03-01 -- Participants: Ken, Alan -- Topic: Strategy call"`
    - `extract_all_files()` skips audio files (handled by Transcribe) and `.context.json` files (metadata only)
    - **DB migration**: `ALTER TABLE enrichments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stage VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'extracting'`
    - **IAM**: transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob, transcribe:GetTranscriptionJob, lambda:InvokeFunction (self-invoke)
    - Frontend build: ~229 KB JS
    - Deployed: xo-enrich Lambda, xo-results Lambda, frontend, CloudFront invalidation, DB migration
    - Files: 4 files modified (schema.sql, enrich/lambda_function.py, results/lambda_function.py, App.jsx)

37. **Enrichment Templates, Structured Output, Client Config** (Session 9 - March 1, 2026)
    - **Default skill template** (`backend/templates/default-skill.md`): ships with every new client
      - 5 sections: Context, Focus Areas, Ignore List, Output Format, Authority Boundaries
      - Editable via Skills screen -- customizes how Claude analyzes each client
      - xo-clients Lambda copies `analysis-template.md` to `{client_id}/skills/` on client creation
      - Skill record inserted into DB (skills table) so it appears in Skills screen immediately
    - **Structured output prompt**: complete rewrite of the First Party Trick prompt
      - ASCII architecture diagrams (box-drawing characters) for proposed systems
      - Table-format database schemas (Column | Type | Description)
      - Schema relationships as explicit `table.column -> table.column` declarations
      - Numbered, measurable actions in 7/14/21 day plan
      - Bottom Line section: direct CEO-level summary (what to do, what it costs, what to expect)
      - New JSON fields: `architecture_diagram`, `schema.relationships`, `bottom_line`
    - **Client config** (`{client_id}/client-config.md`): generated on client creation
      - Structured context document from New Partner form inputs
      - Sections: Company Profile, Primary Contact, Immediate Pain Point, Analysis Instructions
      - Injected into every Claude call as persistent context (like CLAUDE.md for each client)
      - Read by enrich Lambda via `read_client_config()` function
    - **Frontend Results screen enhancements**:
      - New "Bottom Line" panel with red accent bar (appears first, after summary)
      - New "Proposed Architecture" panel with monospace pre-formatted ASCII diagram
      - Schema relationships section below table definitions
    - Frontend build: ~231 KB JS
    - Deployed: xo-clients Lambda, xo-enrich Lambda, frontend, CloudFront invalidation
    - Files: 5 files created/modified (default-skill.md, clients/lambda_function.py, enrich/lambda_function.py, App.jsx, CLAUDE.md)

38. **System Skills Layer + Enrichment Info Popover** (Session 9 - March 1, 2026)
    - **System skills** (`backend/system-skills/`): 4 markdown files always injected into every enrichment call
      - `analysis-framework.md` -- Revenue drivers, cost structure, operational bottlenecks, competitive position, risk factors; quantification rules
      - `output-format.md` -- Numbered sections, table schemas, severity ratings, confidence scores, source citations, bottom line format
      - `authority-boundaries.md` -- What to recommend directly vs flag for human review; hard rules (never recommend firing, never give legal advice, caveat financials)
      - `enrichment-process.md` -- Data source hierarchy: client data (ground truth) > context > audio transcripts > web research > inferred patterns
    - **Three-tier skill injection order** in Claude prompt:
      1. System skills (always, bundled with Lambda, not client-visible)
      2. Client config (client-config.md, generated from partner form)
      3. Client/domain skills (editable in Skills screen, customizable per client)
    - `load_system_skills()` reads from `system-skills/` directory bundled in Lambda package
    - `deploy-enrich.sh` updated to copy `system-skills/*.md` into Lambda package
    - **System Skills section in Configuration screen**: read-only admin view showing all 4 system skills with lock icon and descriptions
    - **Enrichment info popover** on Enrich screen:
      - Info icon (circle) next to Start Enrichment button
      - Click shows popover with 6 numbered steps: Extract, Context, Skills, Web Research, AI Analysis, Output
      - Shows current model badge (Opus/Sonnet) with "Change model in Configuration" hint
      - Dismisses on click outside
    - Frontend build: ~235 KB JS
    - Deployed: xo-enrich Lambda (with system-skills), frontend, CloudFront invalidation
    - Files: 8 files created/modified (4 system-skills .md files, deploy-enrich.sh, enrich/lambda_function.py, App.jsx)

39. **Simplified Skill Creation Form** (Session 10 - March 1, 2026)
    - **Replaced raw markdown textarea** in AddSkillModal with structured plain-English form
    - Four guided fields (no markdown knowledge required):
      - "What should the AI focus on?" -- metrics, problems, themes to prioritize
      - "What should the AI ignore or avoid?" -- topics and assumptions to skip
      - "What does success look like?" -- desired outcomes for the analysis
      - "Any industry terms or jargon to know?" -- domain-specific vocabulary
    - Each field has descriptive hints and placeholder examples
    - **Auto-converts to markdown** behind the scenes via `buildMarkdown()` -- user never sees or writes markdown
    - **Edit mode**: parses existing skill markdown back into structured fields via regex section extraction
    - **Upload mode preserved** for power users: "Advanced: Upload .md file" toggle (accepts .md and .txt)
    - Upload shows file loaded confirmation with character count
    - Tip text updated: "Answer in plain English. The AI will use your answers to guide its analysis."
    - Frontend build: ~238 KB JS
    - Deployed: frontend to S3, CloudFront invalidation
    - Files: 1 file modified (App.jsx)

40. **Skills Empty State & Context Text** (Session 10 - March 1, 2026)
    - **Fixed infinite spinner bug**: When `clientId` is falsy, `fetchSkills` never ran so `loading` stayed `true` forever — added `else { setLoading(false) }` fallback
    - **Improved empty state**: Updated message to "No skills yet. Skills guide how the AI analyzes your business. Add your first skill to get started." with an inline + Add Skill button
    - **Added context text** below Skills header: "Skills teach the AI what to focus on, what to ignore, and what success looks like for your business. Think of them as instructions for your analyst."
    - Frontend build: ~238 KB JS
    - Deployed: frontend to S3, CloudFront invalidation
    - Files: 1 file modified (App.jsx)

41. **Design Consistency + Duplicate Button Fix** (Session 10 - March 1, 2026)
    - **Removed duplicate "+ Add Skill" button** from empty state body — only one in header bar
    - **Restructured Skills screen** to match Enrich screen layout pattern:
      - Single `<div className="panel">` wrapping entire screen (was separate header + list panels)
      - `panel-header` with icon + title + badge + action button on right
      - Inner body `<div style={{ padding: '1.25rem' }}>` matching Enrich padding
    - **Empty state now matches Enrich "Ready to Enrich" design**:
      - Centered icon at `size={64}`, red color, `opacity: 0.5` (same as Sparkles icon on Enrich)
      - Bold heading "No Skills Yet" at `1.125rem` / `fontWeight: 600` (same as "Ready to Enrich Your Data")
      - Description text at `0.875rem`, `color: var(--text-secondary)`, `lineHeight: 1.6` (matches Enrich description)
      - Subtle hint: 'Click **+ Add Skill** above to get started.' in muted text
    - **Context text moved** from standalone paragraph into the centered empty state body
    - **Loading state** also redesigned to match: centered spinner icon at 64px, heading "Loading Skills"
    - **Skill cards** use bordered rows within the single panel body (no nested panels)
    - Frontend build: ~238 KB JS
    - Deployed: frontend to S3, CloudFront invalidation
    - Files: 1 file modified (App.jsx)

42. **Enrichment Info Modal** (Session 10 - March 1, 2026)
    - **Replaced clipped popover** with centered modal overlay — enrichment info was opening downward and falling off screen
    - Uses `modal-overlay` class (same as other modals) for consistent backdrop + centering
    - Card: 400px wide, `maxWidth: 90vw`, rounded corners, shadow
    - Header row with title + X close button
    - Same 6-step content, slightly larger text for readability (0.85rem labels, 0.8rem descriptions)
    - Dismiss on click outside (overlay) or X button
    - Model badge + "Change model in Configuration" footer preserved
    - Frontend build: ~239 KB JS
    - Deployed: frontend to S3, CloudFront invalidation
    - Files: 1 file modified (App.jsx)

43. **Source Library** (Session 11 - March 1, 2026)
    - **New SourcesScreen component** (~400 lines): NotebookLM-style source management
      - **Source Library panel**: card list with file type icon, filename, version badge (v2/v3), source pill (Local/Google Drive), file size, date, active/inactive toggle, kebab menu (Replace, Delete)
      - **Add Sources panel**: drag-and-drop zone with immediate upload, sources strip (Upload, Google Drive, NotebookLM, Dropbox, OneDrive), Google Drive picker modal
      - Summary bar: "X active · Y total · Z MB"
      - Delete confirmation modal, replace with version linking
      - Empty state + no-clientId state
    - **Sidebar**: "Sources" added between Welcome and Enrich (FolderOpen icon)
    - **UploadScreen Step 2 refactored**: Full drag-drop zone replaced with compact summary (source count + "Manage Sources" button). Google Drive code moved to SourcesScreen.
    - **CompanyInfoModal**: Now creates client on save (so Sources screen has clientId for uploads)
    - **Upload button renamed** to "Continue to Enrichment" (files already uploaded via Sources)
    - **DB migration**: 5 new columns on uploads table (status, file_size, version, parent_upload_id, replaced_at) + 2 indexes
    - **Upload Lambda rewritten** as method router: POST /upload + GET /uploads + DELETE /uploads/{id} + PUT /uploads/{id}/toggle + POST /uploads/{id}/replace
    - **Enrich Lambda updated**: Queries active S3 keys from DB, passes to extract_all_files, skips inactive/deleted files
    - Frontend build: ~248 KB JS
    - Branch: feature/source-library
    - Files: 4 files modified (App.jsx, schema.sql, upload/lambda_function.py, enrich/lambda_function.py)

44. **UI Polish, Domain Persistence, Source Library Fixes** (Session 12 - March 1, 2026)
    - **Forgot Password**: Added "Forgot Password?" link + reset form on login screen (email, new password, confirm). Uses POST /auth/reset-password.
    - **clientId persistence**: Fixed Source Library "Complete Domain Expertise First" bug -- clientId now persisted to localStorage, cleared on logout.
    - **Domain Expertise persistence**: Clients Lambda rewritten as method router (GET/PUT/POST). Frontend fetches existing client data on login, pre-populates CompanyInfoModal. Save does upsert (PUT if exists, POST if new). API Gateway routes added for GET/PUT /clients.
    - **Welcome screen cleanup**:
      - Removed redundant "Continue to Enrichment" bar from bottom of page
      - Removed duplicate Enrich/Skills buttons from "AI-Powered Business Intelligence" section
      - Moved Enrich (green #22c55e) and Skills (blue #3B82F6) buttons into Intellagentic Growth card (card 3)
      - Skills button above Enrich button
    - **Source Library kebab menu fixes**:
      - Fixed dropdown overflow: overrode `.panel` `overflow:hidden` with inline `overflow:visible`
      - Wrapper uses `position:relative`, dropdown uses `right:0, top:100%`
      - Restyled: white background, dark text (#1a1a1a), subtle border (#e5e7eb), soft box-shadow
      - Added View menu item (opens S3 URL), divider before Delete (red text)
      - Hover states: #f3f4f6 for View/Replace, #fef2f2 for Delete
    - **Connector pills visibility**: Google Drive + coming-soon pills now use CSS variables for theme compatibility
    - **Upload status default**: Upload Lambda explicitly sets `status='active'` on INSERT (both upload and replace handlers). DB column enforced as NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active'. Fixed existing inactive rows.
    - Branch: feature/source-library
    - Files: App.jsx, clients/lambda_function.py, upload/lambda_function.py

45. **Fix xo-enrich Lambda pydantic_core Import Error** (Session 13 - March 2, 2026)
    - **Root cause**: Local `pip3` is Python 3.14 (macOS ARM). `pip3 install -t package/` installed `pydantic_core` compiled as `cpython-314-darwin.so` — wrong Python version (3.14 vs 3.11) and wrong platform (macOS ARM vs Amazon Linux x86_64).
    - **Symptom**: `[ERROR] Runtime.ImportModuleError: Unable to import module 'lambda_function': No module named 'pydantic_core._pydantic_core'` — all enrichment requests failing.
    - **Fix**: Updated `deploy-enrich.sh` to use platform-targeting flags: `--platform manylinux2014_x86_64 --implementation cp --python-version 3.11 --only-binary=:all:`
    - **Result**: `pydantic_core/_pydantic_core.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` — correct binary for Lambda runtime
    - **Also fixed**: `deploy-gdrive.sh` with same platform flags to prevent future issues
    - Deployed xo-enrich Lambda, verified clean INIT and 200 response
    - Files: deploy-enrich.sh, deploy-gdrive.sh

46. **Delete Modal Contrast Fix** (Session 13 - March 2, 2026)
    - **Delete confirmation modal** on Source Library had low-contrast text (CSS variables blending into dark overlay)
    - Fixed with hardcoded light colors (same pattern as kebab menu fix, build #43):
      - Card background: `#ffffff` with `#e5e7eb` border and depth shadow
      - Heading "Delete Source?": `#1a1a1a` (dark black)
      - Description text: `#444444` (dark gray, was `#6b7280`)
      - Cancel button: `#f3f4f6` background, `#333333` text, `#d1d5db` border
      - Delete button: `#ef4444` background, `#ffffff` text
    - Files: App.jsx

47. **Fix xo-enrich Lambda Self-Invoke Permission** (Session 13 - March 2, 2026)
    - **Root cause**: `xo-lambda-role` IAM role missing `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission
    - xo-enrich uses async self-invoke pattern (Phase 1 calls itself for Phase 2) but the IAM policy was never attached
    - Error: `AccessDeniedException: User xo-lambda-role/xo-enrich is not authorized to perform lambda:InvokeFunction`
    - **Fix**: Added inline IAM policy `xo-lambda-invoke` to `xo-lambda-role`:
      - `lambda:InvokeFunction` on `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-1:941377154043:function:xo-enrich`
      - `transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob` + `transcribe:GetTranscriptionJob` on `*`
    - Verified clean execution with no AccessDeniedException

48. **Model ID Update — Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5** (Session 13 - March 2, 2026)
    - **Updated all model IDs** across the entire stack (4 files, 14 occurrences):
      - Old default: `claude-opus-4-5-20250529` → New default: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
      - Old allowed: `[claude-opus-4-5-20250529, claude-sonnet-4-20250514]` → New allowed: `[claude-opus-4-6, claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929, claude-haiku-4-5-20251001]`
    - **xo-enrich Lambda**: updated defaults, allowed list, Phase 2 fallback, `analyze_with_claude()` default parameter
    - **xo-auth Lambda**: updated `_success_response` default, DB query COALESCE default, `handle_preferences` allowed list
    - **Frontend (App.jsx)**: updated MODEL_LABELS (3 entries), Configuration selector (3 cards: Opus purple, Sonnet blue, Haiku green), default preferredModel
    - **schema.sql**: updated `preferred_model` column default
    - **Configuration screen** now shows 3 model cards:
      - Claude Opus 4.6 (purple #a855f7) — Best analysis, deeper reasoning
      - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (blue #3b82f6) — Balanced speed and quality (default)
      - Claude Haiku 4.5 (green #22c55e) — Fastest responses, lowest cost
    - Deployed: xo-enrich Lambda, xo-auth Lambda, frontend to S3/CloudFront
    - Files: App.jsx, auth/lambda_function.py, enrich/lambda_function.py, schema.sql

49. **Add .docx Extraction to Enrich Lambda** (Session 13 - March 2, 2026)
    - Enrichment failed when only .docx files uploaded — `extract_text()` returned "Unsupported file type: docx"
    - Added `extract_docx()` function using `python-docx` library: extracts paragraph text + table content (rows with pipe-delimited cells)
    - Added `python-docx==1.1.2` to requirements.txt (package size 7.5MB → 13MB)
    - Updated `extract_text()` routing: `docx`/`doc` extensions → `extract_docx()`
    - Deployed and verified: .docx files now extracted successfully
    - Files: enrich/lambda_function.py, enrich/requirements.txt

50. **Frontend Polling Resilience** (Session 13 - March 2, 2026)
    - Frontend showed "Enrichment Failed" because a single failed poll request killed all polling (zero error tolerance)
    - **Fix 1 — Retry tolerance**: Allows up to 5 consecutive failed poll requests before giving up (resets on success)
    - **Fix 2 — 5-minute max timeout**: Polling stops after 5 minutes with helpful message ("Check Results tab — it may have completed")
    - **Fix 3 — Poll interval**: Changed from 2s to 3s (reduces transient failure chance)
    - **Fix 4 — Results Lambda**: Always sets `results['status'] = 'complete'` on response instead of relying on Claude JSON output
    - Deployed: xo-results Lambda + frontend to S3/CloudFront
    - Files: App.jsx, results/lambda_function.py

51. **Fix Claude JSON Truncation — max_tokens + JSON Repair** (Session 13 - March 2, 2026)
    - **Root cause**: `max_tokens=8000` too small for analysis response. Claude's ~28K char response hit the token limit mid-JSON-string, producing `Unterminated string starting at: line 179 column 18 (char 28618)`. Error handler wrote empty results to S3.
    - **Fix 1 — Increased `max_tokens`**: 8000 → 16000 (primary fix — 16K tokens ≈ 64K chars, well above typical responses)
    - **Fix 2 — JSON repair function** (`_repair_truncated_json`): Safety net that closes unclosed strings, strips trailing commas, closes unclosed `[]`/`{}` brackets in correct order. Recovers partial analysis instead of returning empty results.
    - **Fix 3 — Better logging**: Logs `Claude response: {len} chars, stop_reason={stop_reason}` to CloudWatch for debugging truncation vs completion
    - Deployed xo-enrich Lambda
    - Files: enrich/lambda_function.py

52. **Google OAuth Login + Multi-Client Admin Dashboard** (Session 14 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Google OAuth login** for admin users via Google Identity Services (GIS) library
      - Frontend: Google Sign-In button as primary, "Sign in with email instead" link for fallback
      - Backend: `POST /auth/google` — verifies Google ID token via Google's tokeninfo endpoint (stdlib `urllib`, no new deps)
      - Hardcoded `ALLOWED_EMAILS` list: 4 admin emails (alan.moore@intellagentic.io, ken.scott@intellagentic.io, rs@multiversant.com, vn@multiversant.com)
      - Google users created with sentinel `password_hash='google-oauth-no-password'` (blocks password login)
      - JWT includes `is_admin` flag; frontend uses it to show dashboard vs single-client flow
    - **Admin Dashboard** (`DashboardScreen` component)
      - Fetches `GET /clients/list` — returns all clients with source count, enrichment status/date
      - Grid of client cards: company name, industry badge, source count, enrichment status badge (none/processing/complete/error), last enrichment date
      - Click card → fetches full client data, enters workspace scoped to that client
      - "+ New Client" button → opens CompanyInfoModal → creates client → enters workspace
      - Empty state, loading state, error state with retry
    - **Sidebar update**: "All Clients" (Building2 icon) at top for admin users, with divider
    - **Header subtitle**: "Client Dashboard" when on dashboard, company name in workspace
    - **API Gateway**: Added `/auth/google` (POST+OPTIONS → xo-auth), `/clients/list` (GET+OPTIONS → xo-clients), deployed to prod
    - **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID** env var added to xo-auth Lambda (same value from xo-gdrive-import)
    - Self-serve email/password login preserved — non-admin users go straight to single-client workspace
    - Files: auth/lambda_function.py, clients/lambda_function.py, shared/auth_helper.py, App.jsx

53. **Add vn@multiversant.com to Allowed Admin Emails** (Session 14 - March 3, 2026)

    - **Database**: Added `logo_s3_key` and `icon_s3_key` VARCHAR(500) columns to clients table
    - **Upload Lambda** — 2 new endpoints:
      - `POST /upload/branding` — presigned PUT URL for logo or icon, stores S3 key in clients table
      - `GET /upload/branding?client_id=X` — presigned GET URLs for viewing logo/icon
      - Validates content type (PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP), overwrites previous on re-upload
    - **Clients Lambda** — presigned URLs generated server-side:
      - `GET /clients/list` returns `icon_url` per client (presigned GET, 1h expiry) for dashboard cards
      - `GET /clients` returns `logo_url` and `icon_url` for workspace header
    - **Enrich Lambda** — webhook payload updated:
      - `client_logo_url` and `client_icon_url` (direct S3 URLs) added to Streamline webhook
      - Both `_run_enrichment_pipeline` and `_handle_send_to_streamline` include branding
    - **Frontend (App.jsx)**:
      - **CompanyInfoModal** — "Client Branding" section with drag-and-drop/click upload zones for logo (400x100px) and icon (128x128px), thumbnail previews, 2MB client-side validation
      - **Dashboard cards** — 32x32px client icon to left of company name, letter-in-circle fallback
      - **Workspace header** — client logo (20px height) next to company name in subtitle
      - `companyData` state extended with `logoUrl`/`iconUrl`, populated from API responses
    - S3 folder structure: `{client_id}/branding/logo.{ext}` and `{client_id}/branding/icon.{ext}`
    - **Deployment needed**: SQL migration, 3 Lambdas (upload, clients, enrich), API Gateway route `/upload/branding` (GET+POST+OPTIONS), frontend build
    - Files: schema.sql, upload/lambda_function.py, clients/lambda_function.py, enrich/lambda_function.py, App.jsx

55. **Branding Screen — Dedicated Sidebar Page** (Session 15 - March 3, 2026)
    - Moved branding upload from hidden-in-modal to a **dedicated BrandingScreen** component
    - **Sidebar**: Added "Branding" item (Image icon) between Configuration and Light/Dark Mode toggle
      - Only visible when inside a client workspace (hidden on All Clients dashboard)
    - **BrandingScreen** (full page, max-width 700px centered):
      - Company Logo card — large drop zone with drag-and-drop + click-to-browse, preview after upload, "Click or drop to replace" hint
      - Company Icon card — same pattern, square format
      - Preview section (appears after upload): header logo mockup (dark bar with XO box + logo), dashboard card icon mockup (icon + company name)
      - No-client empty state: "No Client Selected" with guidance message
    - Branding upload still also available in CompanyInfoModal (compact version at bottom)
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront
    - Files: App.jsx

56. **Streamline Webhook Toggle** (Session 15 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Database**: Added `streamline_webhook_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` to clients table
    - **Clients Lambda**:
      - `GET /clients` returns `streamline_webhook_enabled` in response
      - `PUT /clients` accepts and persists `streamline_webhook_enabled` (optional field, only updated if present)
    - **Enrich Lambda**:
      - Reads `streamline_webhook_enabled` from clients table in `_run_enrichment_pipeline`
      - Only fires `_send_streamline_webhook()` if flag is true
      - Logs "Streamline webhook disabled for client" when skipped
      - `POST /send-to-streamline` (manual button) unaffected — always works as manual override
    - **Frontend (ConfigurationScreen)**:
      - "Streamline Webhook" panel (Send icon) between System Skills and Configure Buttons
      - Toggle switch: "Send to Streamline" with description, default OFF
      - Persists immediately to DB via `PUT /clients` on toggle
      - Webhook URL displayed read-only below toggle
      - Note: "Send to Streamline button on Results screen works regardless of this toggle"
      - Only shown when inside a client workspace (requires `clientId`)
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront
    - Files: schema.sql, clients/lambda_function.py, enrich/lambda_function.py, App.jsx

57. **Backend Deployment — Branding + Webhook** (Session 16 - March 3, 2026)
    - **SQL Migration**: Ran 3 ALTER TABLE statements via Python/psycopg2 (logo_s3_key, icon_s3_key, streamline_webhook_enabled)
    - **Lambda Deployments**:
      - xo-clients: Updated with branding presigned URLs + webhook toggle fields
      - xo-upload: Updated with `handle_branding_upload()` and `handle_branding_get()` endpoints
      - xo-enrich: Updated with branding in webhook payload + webhook enabled check
    - **API Gateway**: Created `/upload/branding` resource with POST, GET, OPTIONS methods → xo-upload Lambda
    - Added Lambda invoke permission for API Gateway → xo-upload on branding route
    - Deployed API Gateway to prod stage
    - All v1.25–v1.27 backend changes now live

58. **Client Context Bar** (Session 17 - March 3, 2026)
    - Added secondary context bar below the main "XO Capture" header, visible only inside client workspaces
    - **Left side**: "Back to All Clients" link with ChevronLeft icon → navigates to dashboard
    - **Right side**: Client icon (28px with letter fallback), company name (bold), industry pill badge
    - Conditionally rendered: hidden on dashboard, shown when `clientId` is set
    - Simplified header subtitle: removed duplicate company name/logo from main header; shows "Domain Partner Onboarding" in workspace
    - Reused existing patterns: icon fallback from dashboard cards, `navigateTo()`, `companyData` state
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

59. **Client Banner & Header Cleanup** (Session 17 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Header**: Renamed "XO Capture" → "Capture" (XO logo-box already present, text was redundant)
    - **Header subtitle**: Removed entirely in workspace view; only shows "Client Dashboard" on dashboard
    - **Removed context bar** from session 58 — replaced with in-page client identity banner
    - **Client Identity Banner**: Rendered inside `<main>` above screen content (between header and dark cards)
      - Client logo (44px, `companyData.logoUrl`) or letter fallback (44px dark circle, red letter)
      - Company name (1.25rem, bold)
      - "Client Workspace" label below in subtle text
    - Navigation back to dashboard remains in sidebar ("All Clients")
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

60. **Client Banner — Logo-only mode** (Session 17 - March 3, 2026)
    - **With logo**: Shows only the logo image + "Client Workspace" subtitle (no company name text — logo speaks for itself)
    - **Without logo**: Shows letter fallback icon + company name (bold) + "Client Workspace" subtitle
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

61. **Contact Email & Phone Fields** (Session 17 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Frontend**: Added "Contact Email" (email input) and "Contact Phone" (text input for international formats like +44, +1) to Domain Expertise form, between Contact Title and LinkedIn
    - **Database**: Added `contact_email VARCHAR(500)` and `contact_phone VARCHAR(100)` columns to clients table via migration
    - **Clients Lambda**: GET returns `contactEmail`/`contactPhone`, PUT/POST persist both fields, `generate_client_config()` includes email/phone in Primary Contact section
    - **Enrich Lambda**: Reads `contact_email`/`contact_phone` from DB, passes to Streamline webhook as `client_email`/`client_phone`
    - **Schema**: Added ALTER TABLE statements in `schema.sql`
    - Files: `src/App.jsx`, `backend/lambdas/clients/lambda_function.py`, `backend/lambdas/enrich/lambda_function.py`, `backend/schema.sql`
    - Deployed: frontend (S3/CloudFront), xo-clients Lambda, xo-enrich Lambda

62. **Fix xo-clients Lambda — missing auth_helper** (Session 17 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Root cause**: Session 61 deploy zipped only `clients/` directory, missing `auth_helper.py` from `backend/lambdas/shared/`
    - Lambda failed with `Runtime.ImportModuleError: No module named 'auth_helper'`
    - **Fix**: Copied `auth_helper.py` into zip alongside `lambda_function.py`, redeployed
    - Verified: Lambda returns 401 (correct — no auth token in test), no more import errors
    - Dashboard `/clients/list` endpoint restored

63. **Client Banner — show uploaded icon/logo** (Session 17 - March 3, 2026)
    - Banner now uses priority: logo → icon → letter fallback (previously skipped icon)
    - Branding upload state refresh already working (both CompanyInfoModal and BrandingScreen call `setCompanyData` after upload)
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

64. **Video/Audio File Support** (Session 17 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Frontend**: Added `.mp4`, `.webm` to file picker accept list; helper text now reads "Video, Audio"
    - **Enrich Lambda**: Added `mp4`, `webm` to `AUDIO_EXTENSIONS` set and `media_format_map` — routed through existing AWS Transcribe pipeline
    - **Transcribe poll timeout**: 240s → 360s (large video files can take 2–5 min)
    - **Lambda timeout**: 300s → 600s (10 min, accommodates transcription + Claude analysis)
    - Existing pipeline already handles: Transcribe job start, poll, transcript extraction, filename labeling, inclusion in Claude prompt
    - Files: `src/App.jsx`, `backend/lambdas/enrich/lambda_function.py`
    - Deployed: frontend (S3/CloudFront), xo-enrich Lambda, Lambda timeout config

65. **Delete Client from Dashboard** (Session 17 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Frontend**: Trash icon on each client card (gray → red on hover), confirmation modal with hardcoded contrast colors (#1a1a1a heading, #444 description), Cancel + Delete buttons matching source delete style
    - **Backend**: New `handle_delete_client()` in clients Lambda — verifies ownership, deletes from DB (cascades to uploads, enrichments, skills), deletes entire S3 folder via paginated delete
    - **API Gateway**: Added DELETE method on `/clients` resource → xo-clients Lambda proxy integration + invoke permission, deployed to prod
    - Files: `src/App.jsx`, `backend/lambdas/clients/lambda_function.py`
    - Deployed: frontend (S3/CloudFront), xo-clients Lambda, API Gateway

66. **Remove "XO" from sidebar header** (Session 17 - March 3, 2026)
    - Removed redundant XO logo-box from sidebar header — now shows user name + email only
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

67. **Multi-Contact Support Per Client** (Session 18 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Database**: Added `contacts_json TEXT` column to clients table — stores JSON array of contacts
    - **Clients Lambda**: GET returns `contacts` array (with legacy fallback from `contact_*` columns); PUT/POST accept `contacts` array and sync `contacts[0]` to legacy columns for backward compat; `generate_client_config()` renders all contacts with "Primary Contact" / "Contact 2" / etc. headings
    - **Enrich Lambda**: Phase 2 reads `contacts_json` with legacy fallback; `analyze_with_claude()` includes all contacts in prompt enrichment info; `_send_streamline_webhook()` sends both legacy flat fields (from primary) and full `contacts` array
    - **Frontend**: `companyData` state uses `contacts: []` array instead of flat `contactName`/`contactTitle`/etc. fields; CompanyInfoModal renders dynamic contact cards with Add/Remove; each card has 2-column grid (Name, Title, Email, Phone) + full-width LinkedIn; "Primary Contact" badge on first card; empty state with dashed border prompt
    - **Backward compatible**: Existing clients with only legacy `contact_*` columns appear as a single primary contact card when opened
    - Files: `backend/schema.sql`, `backend/lambdas/clients/lambda_function.py`, `backend/lambdas/enrich/lambda_function.py`, `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed: DB migration (RDS), xo-clients Lambda, xo-enrich Lambda, frontend (S3/CloudFront)

68. **Workspace Two-Column Split View** (Session 19 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Layout**: Replaced 3-column horizontal card grid with permanent two-column split layout (38% left / 62% right)
    - **Left Column — Client Profile Card**: Logo/icon/letter avatar, company name + industry badge, website link, all contacts inline (name, title, email, phone) with "Primary" badge on first contact, Add Contact + Edit Details buttons
    - **Right Column — Workflow Cards**: Raw Data and Intellagentic Growth cards stacked vertically with horizontal badge+content layout; step badges renumbered 1 & 2
    - **Removed**: Domain Expertise card (functionality moved to profile card)
    - **Responsive**: flexWrap wrap with minWidth constraints — stacks vertically on narrow viewports
    - **Empty state**: Left column shows "New Partner" button when no client configured
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

69. **Inline Partner Information Form + Domain Expertise Card Restored** (Session 19 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Left Column**: Replaced read-only profile card with always-visible, editable Partner Information form — Company Name, Website URL, Industry, Description, Pain Point fields + Contacts section with Add/Remove (2-col grid: Name, Title, Email, Phone + LinkedIn) + Save button with loading state
    - **Right Column**: Restored Domain Expertise card as first card (step 1, "The Filter") showing company name/industry when saved; Raw Data card (step 2); Intellagentic Growth card (step 3) — all three stacked vertically
    - **No modal needed**: Partner info is edited directly in the left column; form state syncs from companyData on client switch
    - Props added: `setCompanyData` and `onClientCreate` passed to UploadScreen for inline save
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

70. **Light Theme for Partner Information Form** (Session 19 - March 3, 2026)
    - **Left column restyled**: White background (#ffffff), light gray border (#e0e0e0), dark text (#111827) — visually distinct from dark workflow cards on right
    - **Inputs**: Light gray background (#f9fafb) with gray borders (#d1d5db); labels in muted gray (#6b7280)
    - **Contacts**: Cards use #f9fafb background with #e5e7eb borders; inner inputs white with gray borders
    - **Divider**: Changed from semi-transparent white to #e5e7eb
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

71. **Screenshot Tip, Text Input Source, Partner Form Autosave** (Session 20 - March 4, 2026)
    - **Screenshot tip**: Added tip below file drop zone — "You can screenshot WhatsApp messages, text conversations, or any screen and drop them in as images." PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP added to valid upload extensions and file picker accept list
    - **Text input source**: New "Paste Text Source" section in Add Sources panel — source label field + large textarea + "Add Source" button; creates a `.txt` file in S3 (named from label + timestamp) via presigned URL upload, included in enrichment like any other upload
    - **Partner form autosave**: All form fields (Company Name, Website, Industry, Description, Pain Point, all contact inputs) trigger `autoSave` on blur; Save button replaced with subtle "Saving..." spinner / green "Saved" checkmark indicator that fades after 2 seconds; form state syncs on client switch
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

72. **Organization Profile Rename + First/Last Name Split** (Session 20 - March 4, 2026)
    - **Renamed**: "Partner Information" → "Organization Profile" in left column header
    - **Contact name split**: Single `name` field replaced with `firstName`/`lastName` (side by side) across all forms (UploadScreen left column, CompanyInfoModal dashboard form)
    - **Migration**: Frontend `migrateContact()` helper splits legacy `name` on first space; Clients Lambda migrates contacts on-the-fly in GET response; no DB ALTER needed (contacts stored as JSON in `contacts_json` TEXT column)
    - **Clients Lambda**: Legacy `contact_name` column synced as combined `firstName + lastName`; `generate_client_config` renders combined name; legacy fallback splits `contact_name` into first/last
    - **Enrich Lambda**: Streamline webhook payload now sends `first_name`/`last_name` per contact in array + `client_contact_first_name`/`client_contact_last_name` as top-level flat fields; backward-compatible `name` and `display` fields retained
    - Files: `src/App.jsx`, `backend/lambdas/clients/lambda_function.py`, `backend/lambdas/enrich/lambda_function.py`
    - Deployed: frontend (S3/CloudFront), xo-clients Lambda, xo-enrich Lambda

73. **Move Founder Quotes into Right Column** (Session 20 - March 4, 2026)
    - Moved Alan Moore and Ken Scott quotes from full-width section below layout into the right column, below the Intellagentic Growth card
    - 2-column grid within the right column; slightly smaller font sizes to fit narrower space
    - Keeps everything visible on laptop without scrolling past the left column form
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

74. **Organization Address Support** (Session 21 - March 5, 2026)
    - **Multi-address support** for Organization Profile — same JSON array pattern as contacts
    - Each address: Label, Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State/Province, Postal Code, Country
    - **Database**: `ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS addresses_json TEXT` — stores JSON array, first element = primary address
    - **Clients Lambda**: GET returns `addresses` array; PUT/POST accept and store `addresses`; `generate_client_config()` renders addresses section in client-config.md
    - **Enrich Lambda**: Both enrichment paths read `addresses_json` from DB; Streamline webhook payload includes `addresses` array
    - **Frontend (UploadScreen)**: `formAddresses` state with add/update/remove handlers; address cards with Label full-width, Address 1 & 2 full-width, City+State side-by-side, Postal Code+Country side-by-side; autosave on blur; syncs on client switch
    - **Frontend (CompanyInfoModal)**: Matching address UI with Add Address button, same field layout, included in handleSave
    - Layout: Address 1 and 2 full width; City and State side by side; Postal Code and Country side by side
    - First address labeled "Primary Address", subsequent "Address 2, 3..."
    - Files: `backend/schema.sql`, `backend/lambdas/clients/lambda_function.py`, `backend/lambdas/enrich/lambda_function.py`, `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed: frontend (S3/CloudFront), xo-clients Lambda, xo-enrich Lambda, DB migration

75. **Contacts & Addresses Expand/Collapse** (Session 21 - March 5, 2026)
    - **Primary always visible**: Primary Contact and Primary Address cards always shown expanded in Organization Profile
    - **Collapsible extras**: Additional contacts/addresses hidden by default behind clickable links: "View X more contacts" / "View X more addresses" (red text, ChevronDown icon)
    - **Toggle**: Clicking expands to show all; clicking again collapses ("Hide X more contacts/addresses" with ChevronUp icon)
    - **Add button always visible**: "+ Add" button stays accessible regardless of expanded/collapsed state
    - Proper index preservation: uses ternary `null` pattern in `.map()` to maintain original array indices for update/remove handlers
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

76. **Company Name on Contact Cards** (Session 21 - March 5, 2026)
    - Each contact card now displays company/organization name as a read-only row between Name and Title
    - **Layout order**: First Name + Last Name → Company Name (gray, read-only) → Title → Email + Phone → LinkedIn
    - Company name sourced from Organization Profile's Company Name field (`formData.name` in UploadScreen, `localData.name` in CompanyInfoModal)
    - Only shown when company name is populated; hidden otherwise
    - Applied to both UploadScreen left column and CompanyInfoModal
    - Also added expand/collapse to CompanyInfoModal contacts and addresses (matching UploadScreen pattern from v1.44)
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

77. **Login Screen Header Fix** (Session 21 - March 5, 2026)
    - Changed login screen header from "Rapid Deployment" to "Capture" + "Rapid Prototype" badge, matching the logged-in header exactly
    - Single file change: `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

78. **Mobile Responsive Workspace Layout** (Session 21 - March 5, 2026)
    - Two-column workspace layout now stacks vertically on screens ≤768px
    - Organization Profile card goes full width on top, three workflow cards full width below
    - Added CSS classes (`workspace-columns`, `workspace-col-left`, `workspace-col-right`) with `@media (max-width: 768px)` breakpoint using `flex-direction: column`
    - Desktop unchanged: side-by-side 38%/62% split
    - Files: `src/App.jsx`, `src/index.css`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront

79. **Mobile Overflow Fix, System Skills Layout, Per-Client Webhook URL** (Session 22 - March 5, 2026)
    - **Mobile overflow fix**: `.panel` gets `max-width: 100%; overflow: hidden; box-sizing: border-box` at ≤768px; skill card flex children get `minWidth: 0` and `wordBreak: 'break-word'`
    - **System Skills full-width on mobile**: Added `system-skill-grid` className with CSS to force `flex-direction: column` and full-width children; description text wraps instead of `nowrap`
    - **Per-client webhook URL**: New `streamline_webhook_url VARCHAR(1000)` column in clients table; clients Lambda GET returns it, PUT accepts it; enrich Lambda uses per-client URL with env var fallback; frontend replaces read-only display with editable `<input>` that saves onBlur with saving/saved indicator
    - Auto-migration runs on clients Lambda cold start
    - Files: `src/App.jsx`, `src/index.css`, `backend/schema.sql`, `backend/lambdas/clients/lambda_function.py`, `backend/lambdas/enrich/lambda_function.py`
    - Deployed frontend to S3/CloudFront + both Lambdas

80. **Admin Cross-User Client Access** (Session 22 - March 5, 2026)
    - Admin users (`is_admin` JWT flag) can now see and manage ALL clients, not just their own
    - `/clients/list` (GET): admins get all clients across all users; non-admins still filtered by `user_id`
    - `/clients?client_id=X` (GET): admins skip `user_id` filter, can load any client's full data
    - `/clients` (PUT): admins can update any client regardless of owner
    - `/clients` (DELETE): admins can delete any client regardless of owner
    - Fixed bug where clicking a client card on the dashboard showed blank workspace for clients created by other users
    - Non-admin users unchanged — still restricted to their own clients
    - Files: `backend/lambdas/clients/lambda_function.py`
    - Deployed xo-clients Lambda

81. **Fix Enrichment Lambda sniffio Import Error** (Session 22 - March 5, 2026)
    - Enrichment was failing at cold start: `No module named 'sniffio'` (a dependency of the Anthropic SDK)
    - Root cause: `sniffio` module directory was missing from deployment package — only `.dist-info` metadata was present
    - Installed `sniffio` into `package/` directory
    - Also fixed zip build process: was zipping with `package/` prefix (modules at `package/sniffio/`) instead of zipping from inside `package/` (modules at `sniffio/` root level, matching `deploy-enrich.sh`)
    - Verified cold start succeeds with OPTIONS invoke returning 200
    - Files: `backend/lambdas/enrich/package/sniffio/` (new module)
    - Deployed xo-enrich Lambda

82. **Partners Dimension — Channel Partner Model** (Session 23 - March 5, 2026)
    - **New `partners` table**: id, name, company, email, phone, industry, notes, timestamps
    - **New client columns**: `partner_id` (FK to partners, ON DELETE SET NULL), `intellagentic_lead` (boolean)
    - **Partner CRUD endpoints**: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/partners` — admin-only, full CRUD
    - **Client endpoints updated**: list/get/create/update now include `partner_id`, `intellagentic_lead`, `partner_name` (via LEFT JOIN)
    - **Partners screen**: Admin-only CRUD management UI with add/edit modal, delete confirmation, list view
    - **Sidebar nav**: "Partners" item with Users icon, visible only to admins
    - **Dashboard filters**: Partner and Industry dropdown filters in header row; partner name shown under client name in list rows
    - **CompanyInfoModal**: Channel Partner dropdown and Intellagentic Lead checkbox (admin-only fields)
    - **Data flow**: Partners fetched on login, threaded through App state to Dashboard, CompanyInfoModal, PartnersScreen
    - **API Gateway**: Added `/partners` resource with GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/OPTIONS methods, Lambda proxy integration, CORS
    - Auto-migration runs on Lambda cold start
    - Files: `backend/lambdas/clients/lambda_function.py`, `src/App.jsx`
    - Deployed xo-clients Lambda + frontend to S3/CloudFront

**What Works Today:**

The XO Capture prototype is **fully operational** and deployed to production. A domain partner can:

1. Visit https://d36la414u58rw5.cloudfront.net
2. Sign in with Google (admin users) or email/password (self-serve). Admin users see a multi-client dashboard.
3. Fill out company information (8 fields including pain point and enrichment targets)
4. Upload business documents (15 file types supported) or import from Google Drive
5. Add context metadata for audio files (date, participants, topic)
6. Choose AI model in Configuration (Sonnet 4.5 default, Opus 4.6, or Haiku 4.5)
7. Click "Start Enrichment" and watch AI process their data (async with live stage tracking)
8. Receive structured MBA-level business analysis:
   - Executive summary of their business
   - 3-5 critical problems identified with evidence and recommendations
   - ASCII architecture diagram for proposed system
   - Proposed database schema (tables with columns, types, relationships)
   - 7/14/21 day action plan (Build & Demo → Validate & Connect → Deploy or Decide)
   - Bottom line summary (CEO-level: what to do first, cost, expected outcome)
   - Source attribution

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18 + Vite, deployed to S3/CloudFront
- Backend: 7 Python Lambdas behind API Gateway (+ xo-psycopg2 layer)
- Database: PostgreSQL 15 on RDS (db.t3.micro) -- 6 tables
- Auth: Google OAuth (admin) + bcrypt password (self-serve) + JWT tokens (24h expiry, is_admin flag)
- AI: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (default), Opus 4.6, or Haiku 4.5 (user-selectable) via Anthropic API
- Storage: S3 with folder-per-client structure (files + analysis.json)
- Transcription: AWS Transcribe for audio files (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG, FLAC, WMA)
- Integrations: Google Drive (OAuth2 connector with file picker)
- Region: us-west-1 (AWS)

**What's Not Built Yet:**
- Web enrichment (URLs collected but not researched)
- UI for 5 new DB fields (survival metrics, AI persona, strategic objective, tone mode)

**Performance:**
- Upload: Instant (direct to S3 via presigned URLs)
- Enrichment: 30-90 seconds depending on file count and size
- Results: Instant retrieval from S3

**Cost Estimate (100 clients/month):**
- RDS db.t3.micro: ~$15/month
- S3: ~$5 (5GB average)
- Lambda: ~$2
- API Gateway: ~$3.50
- Claude API: $10-50 (variable based on document size)
- **Total: $35-75/month** for prototype usage

**Repository:** All code is version-controlled at https://github.com/intellagentic/xo-quickstart with proper .gitignore to exclude secrets.

**v1.51 — Dashboard Filters: Industry Pills + Domain Partner Dropdown**
- Dashboard now has industry pill filters (horizontal row, red when active) with client counts per industry
- Admin users see a partner dropdown to filter by which user created the client (only shown when 2+ distinct partners exist)
- Filters are AND-combined; header count updates to show filtered total
- Empty filter state shows "No clients match" message with a Clear Filters button
- Backend `/clients/list` now returns `owner_name` via LEFT JOIN on users table

**v1.52 — 7/14/21 Day Action Plan (replaces 30/60/90)**
- Enrichment prompt now produces a 7/14/21 day action plan instead of 30/60/90
- Phases: 7-day (Build & Demo), 14-day (Validate & Connect), 21-day (Deploy or Decide)
- Frontend results heading updated to "7/14/21 Day Action Plan"
- Pain point priority now front-loads the 7-day phase
- Existing results still render correctly (frontend displays phase labels dynamically)

**v1.58 — Dashboard redesign: work queue layout**
- Replaced industry filter pills and partner dropdown with compact inline search/filter input
- Client rows now have left border color coding: green (complete), yellow (processing), red (error), gray (not enriched)
- Row layout: 24px icon + bold company name left, industry in gray text + source count + date + chevron right
- Delete button hidden by default, appears on row hover
- Clients grouped: enriched/processing at top, "Needs Enrichment" divider, unenriched below
- Header reduced to 18px, inline with search field and + New Client button
- Removed enrichmentBadge function (status now conveyed by left border color)

**v1.57 — Compact dashboard, tighter UI, Results breathing room**
- Dashboard: replaced card grid with compact single-row list layout (24px icons, inline industry pill, source count, status badge, date) — scales to 20+ clients
- Global font sizes: body base 13px, section headers 15px, sub-labels 12px, action buttons 13px (Results screen unchanged)
- Welcome step cards: reduced padding (0.875rem → 0.625rem), step circles (40px → 32px), inter-card gap (0.75rem → 0.5rem), smaller buttons — all 3 cards fit on screen without scrolling
- Results screen: added 2rem left/right padding for breathing room, no font/spacing changes

**v1.56 — Partner vs Client view + branding rename**
- All screens (Enrich, Skills, Configuration, Branding) available to both admin and client roles
- Header subtitle: admins see "Partner Workspace", clients see their company name (or "My Workspace")
- Founder quotes hidden for client users on Welcome screen
- Download Prototype Spec (.md) and Send to Streamline buttons hidden for clients on Results screen
- Renamed "Download Prototype Spec" button to "Download Prototype Spec (.md)" for clarity
- Download Prototype Spec (.md) button styled black background with white text
- Clients skip the All Clients dashboard, go straight to their workspace
- Replaced all "First Party Trick" references with "XO Capture Analysis" across system skill (analysis-framework.md), enrich Lambda prompt, S3, and database

**v1.55 — Narrower sidebar layout**
- Sidebar width reduced from 280px to 220px so main content stays visible
- Overlay opacity lightened (50% to 25%) to keep workspace context
- Tightened padding, font sizes (0.9rem to 0.8rem), icon sizes (20px to 17px), and gaps across all sidebar items
- Theme toggle switch scaled down, text-overflow ellipsis on header name/email
- All icons use flexShrink: 0 to prevent compression at narrow width

**v1.54 — Rapid Prototype Spec Generator**
- New `xo-rapid-prototype` Lambda generates a Claude Code-ready markdown build spec from enrichment results + client metadata
- "Download Prototype Spec" red button on Results screen (next to Send to Streamline) triggers .md file download
- Spec includes: client context, problem analysis, features, database schema, seed data instructions, tech stack, UI layout, API endpoints, build sequence checklist
- "Rapid Prototype" added as default configurable button (Download icon, red, routes to results)
- Download icon added to ICON_MAP for configurable buttons
- API Gateway: GET /rapid-prototype/{id} with CORS OPTIONS

**v1.53 — Global System Skills (DB-managed, admin-editable)**
- System skills (analysis-framework, output-format, authority-boundaries, enrichment-process) are now first-class DB entities
- `skills.client_id` is now nullable: NULL = system skill (global), set = client skill
- Auto-migration seeds 4 system skills into DB on Lambda cold start + copies .md files to S3 `_system/skills/`
- New `/skills` API endpoints: GET (combined or system-only), POST, PUT, DELETE with admin gating for system scope
- Skills screen shows system skills (blue "System" badge) at top, then client skills (gray "Client" badge) with divider
- Admins can create/edit/delete system skills; non-admins see them read-only
- Add Skill modal has scope selector for admins: "This client only" vs "System (all clients)"
- Enrich Lambda reads system skills from DB first, falls back to bundled files if DB empty
- Configuration screen system skills panel now dynamically fetches from API instead of hardcoded list

**v1.93 — Intellagentic Lead and Channel Partner on UploadScreen**

- Added Intellagentic Lead toggle and Channel Partner dropdown to UploadScreen form (admin only)
- Two-column grid row between Industry and Current Business Description
- Intellagentic Lead: red toggle button with checkmark when active, autosaves on click
- Channel Partner: select dropdown populated from partners list, "No partner" to clear, autosaves on change
- Both fields added to formData state and sync useEffect, already wired to API via `intellagentic_lead` and `partner_id`
- Partners list passed as prop from main App component
- Deployed: frontend only

**v1.92 — Export All Skills as .doc**

- Added `exportAllAsDocx()`: combines all skills into a single `.doc` file with page breaks between skills
- Office-compatible HTML with Word namespace, Calibri font, styled headings
- Two separate export buttons in header: `.doc` (Download icon) and `.md` (FileText icon)
- Deployed: frontend only

**v1.91 — Skills concertina view with inline editor and export**

- Skills screen converted from flat card list to accordion/concertina: click header to expand, chevron rotates on open
- Only one skill open at a time; unsaved-changes prompt when switching or closing
- Expanded state: monospace textarea inline editor for editable skills (client skills + system for admins)
- Read-only view (pre-formatted) for system skills when non-admin
- Inline save: amber "Unsaved changes" indicator, red Save button with spinner, calls PUT /skills directly
- Per-skill export: FileText icon exports as .md, Download icon exports as .doc (Office-compatible HTML with Word namespace)
- Export All button in header: combines all skills into single skills-export.md with --- separators
- Delete button per skill (trash icon) in accordion header
- Deployed: frontend only

**v1.90 — Sidebar hover-expand and pin/unpin**

- Hover: mouseover on collapsed icon strip temporarily expands sidebar with labels; mouseout collapses back
- Pin: clicking hamburger (collapsed) or lock icon (hover-expanded) pins sidebar open permanently; content shifts to make room
- Unpin: clicking chevron-left on pinned sidebar unpins it back to icon strip
- Hover-expand overlays content (no layout shift); pinned state pushes content via margin
- Stronger drop shadow on hover-expanded state to distinguish from pinned
- Pin state persisted in localStorage (`xo-sidebar-pinned`)
- Mobile: nav clicks auto-collapse and unpin
- Deployed: frontend only

**v1.89 — Bedrock bearer token authentication**

- Added `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` env var support for bearer token auth with Bedrock
- When set: calls Bedrock REST API directly with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header (no boto3 Bedrock client needed)
- When not set: falls back to Lambda IAM role via boto3 (unchanged behavior)
- `_invoke_bedrock_bearer()`: direct HTTPS POST to `bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com/model/{model}/invoke` with 300s timeout
- Removed previous `BEDROCK_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`BEDROCK_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`/`BEDROCK_SESSION_TOKEN` — replaced by single bearer token
- Auth mode logged on cold start for debugging
- Deployed: backend only (enrich Lambda)

**v1.88 — Switch from Anthropic API to AWS Bedrock**

- Replaced `anthropic` SDK with `boto3` Bedrock Runtime client in enrich Lambda
- `bedrock_client.invoke_model()` replaces `anthropic_client.messages.create()`
- Bedrock Messages API format: `anthropic_version: bedrock-2023-10-16`
- Model mapping: `claude-opus-4-6` → `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-20250514-v1:0`, `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` → `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514-v1:0`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` → `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`
- Removed `anthropic==0.40.0` from requirements.txt (smaller deploy package)
- No longer needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var; new optional `BEDROCK_REGION` (default `us-west-2`)
- Requires: Lambda IAM role needs `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission, Bedrock model access enabled in AWS console
- Deployed: backend only

**v1.87 — Collapsible sidebar with persistent icon strip**

- Replaced overlay sidebar with persistent collapsible sidebar: 220px expanded, 56px icon strip collapsed
- Expanded state: icon + label for each nav item, user name/email in header, chevron-left to collapse
- Collapsed state: centered icons only with tooltip on hover, hamburger menu icon to expand
- State persisted in localStorage across sessions; defaults to expanded on desktop (>768px), collapsed on mobile
- `SidebarItem` reusable component handles both states with smooth CSS transitions
- Theme toggle and Sign Out pinned to bottom of sidebar (always accessible)
- On mobile, nav clicks auto-collapse the sidebar
- Header changed from `position: fixed` to `position: sticky` (lives inside content wrapper, respects sidebar offset)
- Footer offset tracks sidebar width dynamically
- Removed `padding-top: 80px` from `.main` (no longer needed with sticky header)
- Deployed: frontend + CSS

**v1.86 — NDA signed timestamp tracking**

- New `nda_signed_at TIMESTAMP` column on clients table (auto-migration)
- When `ndaSigned` set to true: `nda_signed_at` automatically set to `NOW()`
- When `ndaSigned` set to false: `nda_signed_at` cleared to null
- Create also sets `nda_signed_at` if `ndaSigned` is true at creation time
- GET, List endpoints return `ndaSignedAt` as ISO timestamp or null
- Deployed: backend only

**v1.85 — 2FA opt-in: only check when user has enabled it**

- 2FA is now opt-in per user via `users.two_factor_enabled` (boolean, default false)
- Login flows (password + all 4 Google OAuth paths) check `two_factor_enabled` before triggering 2FA challenge
- If 2FA disabled: login returns JWT directly as before (no behavior change for existing users)
- If 2FA enabled: login returns `{ requires_2fa: true, session_id, masked_email }` → user enters code → `POST /auth/verify-2fa` returns JWT
- New accounts and registrations skip 2FA (user hasn't opted in yet)
- Magic link token validation still exempt from 2FA
- `PUT /auth/preferences` accepts `{ two_factor_enabled: true/false }` to toggle 2FA on/off
- `_success_response` now includes `two_factor_enabled` in user data so frontend can show toggle state
- Deployed: backend only

**v1.84 — Email-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

- New `two_factor_codes` table: session_id, user_id, 6-digit code, encrypted user context, expiry, attempt counter
- New endpoint `POST /auth/verify-2fa`: accepts `{ session_id, code }`, validates code, issues JWT on success
- Login flow (when 2FA enabled): credentials validated → 6-digit code emailed via AWS SES → frontend shows code entry → verify-2fa returns JWT
- Security: codes expire after 10 minutes, max 5 attempts per session, codes deleted after use
- Email: HTML + plaintext via SES with branded template, configurable `SES_FROM_EMAIL` and `SES_REGION` env vars
- User context (role, partner_id, client_id, preferred_model) stored encrypted in DB during 2FA, restored on verification
- Requires: SES sender email verified in AWS, `POST /auth/verify-2fa` route added to API Gateway
- Deployed: backend only (frontend 2FA code entry screen needed)

**v1.83 — NDA signed flag and Existing Apps per client**

- New `nda_signed` (boolean, default false) and `existing_apps` (text) columns on clients table
- Auto-migration adds columns on cold start
- Create, Update, GET, and List endpoints all support `ndaSigned` (boolean) and `existingApps` (string)
- Update is conditional: only sets these fields when present in the PUT body
- Deployed: backend only

**v1.82 — updated_by tracking, owner_name decryption, layer version fix**

- Bug fix: `owner_name` in client list was returning encrypted blob — now decrypted with `decrypt()` (master key)
- New `updated_by` column on clients table: stores encrypted name of the user who last created or updated the client
- `handle_update_client`: sets `updated_by = encrypt(user.name)` on every save
- `handle_create_client`: sets `updated_by = encrypt(user.name)` on create
- `handle_get_client` and `handle_list_clients` both return decrypted `updated_by` in response
- Auto-migration adds `updated_by TEXT` column on cold start
- Layer fix: all 8 Lambdas updated from `bcrypt-jwt-layer:1` to `:2` (which includes `cryptography` library for AES-GCM encryption)
- `deploy.sh` now dynamically resolves latest layer versions instead of hardcoding `:1`
- Deployed: backend only

**v1.81 — Encryption fixes, deploy hardening, API activity logging**

**Encryption fixes (crypto_helper.py):**
- Bug fix: `AES_MASTER_KEY` was cached at module import time — now reads from `os.environ` on every call so config changes take effect immediately
- Bug fix: `unwrap_client_key()` returned garbage bytes when encryption was unavailable — encrypted keys (nonce+ciphertext) were blindly base64-decoded and used as client keys, causing silent decryption failures. Now detects encrypted vs raw keys by length (raw = exactly 32 bytes) and returns `None` when it can't unwrap
- Bug fix: `unwrap_client_key()` didn't detect when master key decryption failed (returned input unchanged) — now returns `None` instead of proceeding with still-encrypted value
- Added logging throughout: warnings for missing key/library, pass-through mode, unwrap failures; debug logs for individual decrypt attempts

**Deploy hardening (deploy.sh):**
- `AES_MASTER_KEY` now required as first argument: `./deploy.sh <AES_MASTER_KEY>`
- Existing Lambda updates: merges `AES_MASTER_KEY` + `AES_ENCRYPTION_KEY` into existing env vars (preserves DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.)
- New Lambda creates: includes `AES_MASTER_KEY` + `AES_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the start
- Added `aws lambda wait function-updated` between code and config updates to prevent race conditions

**API activity logging (all 8 Lambdas):**
- Added `log_activity()` to `auth_helper.py` — logs HTTP method, path, user email, status code, and result summary
- All Lambda handlers now log every request: `API POST /auth/login | user=ken@example.com | status=200 | role=admin`
- Auth lambda has custom `_log_auth_activity()` that extracts email from request body (login/register) or JWT
- Failed auth (401) and errors (500) are logged with error details
- Deployed: backend only

**v1.80 — Fix Paste Text Source "Add Source" button**
- Bug: `new File()` was calling lucide-react's `File` icon (imported on line 2) instead of the browser's native `File` constructor, causing "Tn is not a constructor" error
- Fix: changed to `globalThis.File` to bypass the shadowed import
- Added S3 PUT response status check (was silently ignoring upload failures)
- Added success confirmation: button turns green with checkmark + "Source Added!" for 3 seconds
- Added inline error display with specific error message on failure
- Added empty-label fallback (`'Text_Note'`) when sanitized label is empty
- Deployed: frontend only

**v1.79 — Invite countdown timer updated to March 23**
- Changed countdown target from March 16, 2026 10:00 AM PST to March 23, 2026 12:00 PM PDT
- Updated confirmation text from "March 16" to "March 23"
- Deployed: frontend only

**v1.78 — System vs Client Buttons (same pattern as Skills)**
- Buttons table schema migrated: added `client_id` column (nullable, FK to clients), made `user_id` nullable
- System buttons (`client_id IS NULL, user_id IS NULL`) appear on every client's Welcome screen before client-specific buttons
- Client buttons (`client_id = X`) are per-workspace, configured from client Configuration screen
- Buttons Lambda auto-migrates on cold start (adds column, drops NOT NULL, creates index)
- GET /buttons supports `?scope=system`, `?scope=client&client_id=X`, `?client_id=X` (combined), and legacy (no params)
- PUT /buttons/sync supports `{ scope: "system" }` (admin only), `{ client_id: X }`, and legacy (user-level)
- System Configuration screen (dashboard, admin): full Configure Buttons editor with drag-and-drop reorder, inline edit (label, URL, color grid, icon grid), "+ Add Button", and live preview
- Client Configuration screen (workspace): system buttons shown read-only with Lock icon + blue "System" badge; client buttons editable below with full editor; live preview shows both combined
- Reusable `renderButtonEditor()` and `renderButtonPreview()` helpers shared between system and client config views
- Frontend state: separate `systemButtons` + `configButtons` arrays; re-fetches client buttons on workspace entry
- Deployed: xo-buttons Lambda + frontend

**v1.77 — Reorder System Configuration: toggle below URL fields**
- Moved "Send to Streamline" toggle below Default Enrichment Webhook URL (order: Invite URL → Enrichment URL → toggle)
- Updated help text to "Per-client settings (in client Configuration) override these system defaults."
- Deployed: frontend only

**v1.76 — System-level Send to Streamline toggle**
- New "Send to Streamline" toggle on System Configuration screen, below Default Enrichment Webhook URL
- Stored in `system_config` table as `streamline_webhook_enabled` (`"true"` / `"false"`), OFF by default
- xo-enrich Lambda: after enrichment completes, checks per-client toggle first; if OFF, falls back to system-level toggle from `system_config`
- Precedence: per-client ON → fires; per-client OFF → check system default; system ON → fires; system OFF → manual only
- `_get_system_config_value()` updated to handle `conn=None` by opening its own DB connection (needed post-enrichment when main conn is closed)
- Deployed: xo-enrich Lambda + frontend

**v1.75 — Verified system_config webhook flow end-to-end**
- Verified save-on-blur: PUT `/system-config` writes to DB immediately, returns `{"status":"saved"}`, frontend shows 2-second "Saved" indicator
- Verified no caching: `handle_invite` runs fresh `SELECT` from `system_config` on every invocation — no module-level or Lambda-warm cache
- Live test: changed invite webhook URL from `httpbin.org/post` to `httpbin.org/anything`, submitted two invites — Lambda logs confirm each fired to the correct URL at time of submission
- Both invite paths (new invite + existing-invite duplicate email) read from `system_config`

**v1.74 — System Configuration: system_config table + dual-mode Configuration screen**
- New `system_config` PostgreSQL table (config_key/config_value key-value store), auto-migrated on Lambda cold start
- New `GET /system-config` and `PUT /system-config` API routes (admin-only) on xo-clients Lambda
- API Gateway `/system-config` resource with GET, PUT, OPTIONS methods → xo-clients Lambda proxy
- Configuration screen is now dual-mode based on `inWorkspace` state:
  - **Dashboard (System Configuration):** Shows "System Configuration" header with Global Webhook URLs panel (Invite Webhook URL + Default Enrichment Webhook URL), both saving to `system_config` on blur
  - **Client workspace (Client Configuration):** Shows "Client Configuration" header with client name, then per-client settings (theme, AI model, system skills, per-client webhook override URL + toggle, configurable buttons)
- `inWorkspace` state tracks whether user is in a client workspace or on dashboard level
- Invite webhook lookup in `handle_invite` now reads from `system_config` table instead of scanning clients table
- xo-enrich Lambda: per-client `streamline_webhook_url` falls back to `system_config.enrichment_webhook_url` before env var
- Removed standalone SystemSettingsScreen — unified into single ConfigurationScreen component
- Deployed: xo-clients Lambda, xo-enrich Lambda, API Gateway, frontend

**v1.73 — Invite Webhook URL: per-client configuration**
- New `invite_webhook_url VARCHAR(1000)` column on clients table, auto-migrated on Lambda cold start
- Configuration screen now shows two webhook URL fields under Streamline toggle: "Enrichment Webhook URL" (renamed from "Webhook URL") and "Invite Webhook URL" (new)
- Both fields save on blur with "Saved" indicator
- `_send_invite_webhook()` uses per-client `invite_webhook_url` if set, falls back to `STREAMLINE_INVITE_WEBHOOK_URL` env var
- Added to all 4 SELECT queries, response mapping, and PUT handler in clients Lambda
- Existing-invite path (duplicate email) also passes per-client URL from DB
- Deployed: xo-clients Lambda + frontend

**v1.72 — Country code dropdown on all phone fields**
- Added country code dropdown before phone number input across all 4 locations: Invite page, CompanyInfoModal, Partner Info modal, inline auto-save form
- Country codes: +1 (US/Canada), +44 (UK), +61 (Australia), +353 (Ireland), +256 (Uganda), +971 (UAE) — defaults to +1
- Shared utilities at top of App.jsx: `COUNTRY_CODES` array, `splitPhone()` parser, `joinPhone()` combiner
- Stored as combined value (e.g. `+44 7700900123`) — `splitPhone()` parses existing values to pre-select correct dropdown
- Small dropdown on left, phone input taking remaining width on right

**v1.71 — XO + Streamline dual-layer architecture in system skills**
- Updated `analysis-framework.md` system skill to distinguish XO (intelligence layer) from Streamline (action layer)
- XO capabilities: runtime monitoring, pattern detection, anomaly surfacing, decision support, predictive alerts, compliance watching, exception-based management
- Streamline capabilities: workflow automation, document generation, notifications, form logic, e-signatures, task routing
- Tagline embedded: "The XO clears the path. You give the Order. Streamline Acts."
- Every recommendation now requires: Problem → XO monitors → Streamline executes → Outcome
- Updated `output-format.md` with 3 new rules: Proposed Architecture must include both XO and Streamline components, Problems section must use XO verbs vs Streamline verbs, Action Plan items indicate XO vs Streamline setup tasks
- Deployed to S3 (`_system/skills/`), Lambda package (bundled fallback), and redeployed `xo-enrich` Lambda

**v1.70 — Fix Enrich screen stage progress display**
- Fixed bug where AI Analysis appeared to start before Transcribing Audio completed
- Backend Lambda confirmed sequential — bug was in frontend `updateStageStatus()` display logic
- Rewrote `updateStageStatus` with index-based logic: all stages before current → 'complete', current → active, all after → 'pending'
- Old logic only marked prior stages complete if they were 'pending', so skipped stages (e.g. no audio files) or stages that were still 'active' could overlap visually
- Added immediate `updateStageStatus('extracting', 'active')` call at enrichment start (was only set on first 3-second poll)

**v1.69 — Organization Profile textarea sizing, workspace logo, copyright footer**
- Organization Profile textareas (Current Business Description, Future Plans, Pain Points) set to `rows={4}` with `minHeight: 100px` across all 3 form instances (CompanyInfoModal, Partner Info modal, inline form)
- Client logo/icon in workspace header increased from 44px to 56px (logo, icon, and letter fallback) for better visibility
- Copyright footer "© 2026 Intellagentic Limited. All rights reserved." verified on all screens
- Added missing footer to LoginScreen (was the only screen without it)
- All other screens (Dashboard, Welcome, Sources, Enrich, Results, Skills, Configuration, Branding, Partners, Invite) already had footer via fixed-position element

**v1.68 — Invite Landing Page for HIMSS 2026**
- New public `/invite` page — dark-themed, mobile-first landing page for conference signups (no auth required)
- `InvitePage` component: dark gradient background, XO Capture header, "Invitation" heading, tagline
- Tagline split across two lines: "XO clears the path." / "You decide. Streamline Acts."
- "Your Second-in-Command" subtitle below countdown
- Live countdown timer to March 16, 2026 10:00 AM PST (4 red-tinted boxes: Days/Hrs/Min/Sec)
- Glass-morphism form card with 6 fields: First Name + Last Name (side-by-side row), Email, Phone, LinkedIn (optional, icon label), Company
- All fields have proper autocomplete attributes: given-name, family-name, email, tel, url, organization
- LinkedIn field: SVG icon label, placeholder "linkedin.com/in/yourprofile", optional
- Submit → `POST /invite` → creates client (S3 folders, client-config.md, default skill) + generates 30-day magic link (stored, not shown)
- Confirmation screen: CheckCircle icon, "You're in.", "We'll send your access on March 16.", Intellagentic logo — no magic link displayed
- Idempotent: same email returns success (no duplicate clients)
- Backend: `handle_invite()` in clients Lambda, routed before auth check
- Phone number stored in `contact_phone`, LinkedIn in `contact_linkedin`, full name in `contact_name` — all included in client-config.md
- Auto-migration: `source` column on clients table, `user_id` made nullable for invite clients
- Dedicated invite webhook via `STREAMLINE_INVITE_WEBHOOK_URL` env var (separate from enrichment webhook)
- Invite webhook payload: `invite_submission` event with first_name, last_name, email, phone, linkedin, company_name, signup_date
- API Gateway: `/invite` resource with POST + OPTIONS methods → Lambda proxy to xo-clients
- `STREAMLINE_INVITE_WEBHOOK_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` env vars added to clients Lambda
- CloudFront SPA routing handles `/invite` path (404 → index.html already configured)
- Single-viewport layout: entire page fits without scrolling on laptop (1440x900) and mobile (375x812)
- Tightened spacing: centered flex layout with gap, compact countdown boxes, reduced form/button padding
- Tagline prominent: 17px near-white (#e0e0e0) with line break — "XO clears the path." / "You decide. Streamline Acts."
- Submit button text: "I'm In"
- Footer matches main app: © 2026 Intellagentic Limited. All rights reserved.

**v1.66 — Streamline Applications: new system skill + Potential Streamline Applications on Results screen**
- New system skill: `streamline-applications.md` — full reference of 12 Streamline workflow steps and 15 integrations
- Instructs AI to identify 3-5 practical Streamline workflow applications ranked by ease of implementation and business impact
- Each application includes: business problem, workflow steps used, applicable integrations, operational outcome
- Enrich Lambda prompt updated with section 8 (POTENTIAL STREAMLINE APPLICATIONS) and `streamline_applications` field in JSON output
- Results screen: new "Potential Streamline Applications" panel between Client Summary and Executive Summary
- Black header (#1a1a1a) with white text and Intellistack logo (copied from surgical-trays assets)
- Parses bold headers, labeled fields (Problem/Workflow/Integrations/Outcome), bullets, and paragraphs
- Color-coded labels: Problem (red #ef4444), Workflow (blue #3b82f6 matching Send to Streamline button), Integrations/Outcome (gray #6b7280)
- `streamline_applications` included in Streamline webhook payload
- 6 system skills total: analysis-framework, output-format, authority-boundaries, enrichment-process, client-facing-summary, streamline-applications

**v1.65 — Add client_summary to Streamline webhook payload**
- Enrich Lambda webhook now includes `client_summary` field (XO Summary for Client) alongside existing sections
- Applies to both automatic post-enrichment webhook and manual "Send to Streamline" re-send
- No frontend changes

**v1.64-hotfix — Revert dashboard grouping to restore stable state**
- Reverted v1.65 (dashboard grouped by Channel Partner) and v1.66 (ErrorBoundary) — both caused blank screen crash (React error #310)
- Restored App.jsx to v1.64 stable state (flat client list, no ErrorBoundary)
- Dashboard partner grouping to be re-implemented on a feature branch

**v1.64 — Client-facing summary: new system skill + XO Summary for Client on Results screen**
- New system skill: `client-facing-summary.md` — instructs AI enrichment to produce a concise, client-ready summary
- Summary opens with "Based on the information provided, XO has identified the following opportunities for [Company Name]:"
- 3-5 bullet points framed as business outcomes — no tech jargon, no pricing, no internal tools
- Closes with forward-looking next steps statement
- Enrich Lambda prompt updated with section 7 (CLIENT SUMMARY) and `client_summary` field in JSON output schema
- Results screen: new "XO Summary for Client" panel at top with red gradient header (Star icon), above Executive Summary
- Bullet lines parsed and rendered with red dot markers; non-bullet lines as paragraphs
- Skill auto-seeded to DB via `SYSTEM_SKILLS` list in clients Lambda + uploaded to S3 `_system/skills/`
- 5 system skills total: analysis-framework, output-format, authority-boundaries, enrichment-process, client-facing-summary

**v1.63 — Enhanced organization forms: future plans, multi-entry pain points, website links**
- Renamed "Description" to "Current Business Description" across all forms (CompanyInfoModal, UploadScreen, PartnersScreen)
- Added "Future Plans" textarea field — captures strategic direction and growth plans
- Replaced single "Immediate Pain Point" with multi-entry Pain Points section — add/remove individual entries, stored as JSON array
- Website URL field now has clickable external link icon (ExternalLink) that opens URL in new tab
- DB migration: `future_plans` + `pain_points_json` columns on clients table; `description` + `future_plans` + `pain_points_json` on partners table
- Backend `generate_client_config()` updated to include Future Plans section and numbered Pain Points list in Claude analysis context
- All three forms consistent: CompanyInfoModal (modal), UploadScreen (inline autosave), PartnersScreen (modal)
- handleClientCreate PUT/POST bodies now send `futurePlans` and `painPoints` to backend

**v1.62 — Partner form aligned with Organization Profile + role fix**
- Partner Add/Edit form now matches client Organization Profile modal exactly
- Organization fields: Company/Organization Name, Website URL, Industry/Vertical
- Contacts section: expandable cards with First Name, Last Name, Title, Email, Phone, LinkedIn (same as client contacts)
- Addresses section: expandable cards with Label, Address 1/2, City, State/Province, Postal Code, Country
- Same field styling, expand/collapse behavior, empty states, and "Add Contact"/"Add Address" buttons
- DB migration adds `website`, `contacts_json`, `addresses_json` columns to partners table
- Backend CRUD updated to store/return structured contacts and addresses arrays
- Partner list rows now show primary contact name + title instead of just email
- Fixed: partner save now checks API response and shows error if save fails (was silently swallowing errors)
- Fixed: old JWTs missing `role` field caused 403 "Access denied" on partner routes — now derives role from `is_admin`/`is_partner` flags as fallback

**v1.61 — Three-tier role system: Admin, Partner, Client**
- Database-driven role system: `role` column on users table ('admin', 'partner', 'client') + `partner_id` FK to partners table
- Admin seed emails auto-provisioned on cold start (replaces hardcoded ALLOWED_EMAILS for login)
- Auth Lambda login flow: DB role check → admin seed fallback → client contacts_json match → denied
- JWT claims now include: `role`, `is_admin`, `is_partner`, `is_client`, `partner_id`, `client_id`
- Partner-scoped access across all lambdas: partners see/manage only clients with matching partner_id
- Partners can: view dashboard (filtered), create clients (auto-assigned), upload/enrich, share magic links for their clients
- Partners cannot: delete clients, access Partners management screen, see other partners' clients
- Frontend: `isPartner` state, partner login → "Partner Dashboard" with "My Clients" sidebar, no partner filter/delete buttons
- Workspace banner shows "Partner Workspace" for both admin and partner roles
- All 4 auth_helper.py files updated to propagate role/is_partner/partner_id from JWT

**v1.60 — Client Access: Magic Links + Google OAuth for Clients**
- New `client_tokens` table for magic link tokens (64-char hex, 30-day expiry, per-client)
- `POST /auth/token` validates magic link tokens, issues client-scoped JWT
- `POST/GET/DELETE /auth/magic-link` for admin/partner management of shareable URLs
- Google OAuth now checks `contacts_json` on clients table — matching contact emails get client-scoped access
- Client-scoped access in upload + clients lambdas (users see only their own workspace)
- Frontend: `?token=` URL parameter auto-validates and enters workspace, `ShareLinkModal` component
- Share buttons on dashboard rows (ExternalLink icon) and workspace header for admins
- API Gateway: `/auth/token` (POST) and `/auth/magic-link` (GET/POST/DELETE) resources added

**v1.94–v1.98 — HubSpot CRM Bi-directional Sync (complete integration)**

Backend Lambda (`xo-hubspot-sync`, eu-west-2, Python 3.11, 60s timeout):
- Private App bearer token auth via `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_TOKEN` env var (replaced initial OAuth 2.1 approach after scope issues)
- 12 custom HubSpot Company properties auto-created on first sync: xo_record_type, xo_client_id, xo_industry, xo_status, xo_source, xo_nda_signed, xo_nda_signed_at, xo_intellagentic_lead, xo_future_plans, xo_pain_points_json, xo_addresses_json, xo_sync_enabled
- Industry mapped to `xo_industry` custom text property (HubSpot's native `industry` field is an enum that rejects free-text)
- DateTime fields (nda_signed_at) sent as Unix epoch milliseconds per HubSpot API requirements

API routes (10 endpoints on API Gateway `odvopohlp3`, all with CORS OPTIONS):
- `POST /hubspot/connect` — returns Private App status message
- `GET /hubspot/callback` — returns Private App status message (OAuth no longer needed)
- `GET /hubspot/status` — live connectivity test via HubSpot read, returns auth_type + last_sync
- `POST /hubspot/sync` — full bi-directional sync with push + pull + conflict detection
- `POST /hubspot/sync/push` — push single client to HubSpot
- `POST /hubspot/sync/pull` — pull single company from HubSpot into XO
- `GET /hubspot/mapping` — returns full field mapping + pull behavior documentation
- `GET /hubspot/conflicts` — returns unresolved sync conflicts
- `POST /hubspot/conflicts/resolve` — resolves conflict by choosing XO or HubSpot as winner
- `POST /hubspot/webhook?secret=xxx` — pull-only sync triggered by external webhook (no JWT, shared secret auth)

Push (XO Capture → HubSpot):
- company_name→name, website_url→website, description→description
- Custom properties: xo_industry, xo_future_plans, xo_status, xo_source, xo_nda_signed, xo_nda_signed_at, xo_intellagentic_lead, xo_pain_points_json, xo_addresses_json
- contacts_json → multiple HubSpot Contacts associated to Company
- addresses_json → xo_addresses_json custom property + HubSpot standard address fields from primary address
- partner_id → Company-to-Company association with partner's HubSpot Company record
- Enrichment results (summary, bottom_line) → HubSpot Note on Company

Pull (HubSpot → XO Capture):
- Tag-based: only creates new XO client records for companies with `xo_sync_enabled=true` checkbox
- Existing linked records (with xo_client_id) continue syncing normally regardless of checkbox
- All contacts pulled into contacts_json array on client record
- All custom properties synced back to corresponding XO fields

Dedup logic:
- URL normalization: strips protocol, www prefix, trailing slashes, lowercases before comparing
- Searches both HubSpot `domain` and `website` properties with normalized comparison
- Falls back to company name fuzzy match (CONTAINS_TOKEN)
- Tracked via hubspot_company_id in clients/partners tables

Conflict resolution:
- Timestamp-based: compares xo.updated_at vs hs.hs_lastmodifieddate vs hubspot_last_sync
- First sync (NULL last_sync): HubSpot authoritative, overwrites XO values
- Ongoing: only the side that changed since last sync wins
- True conflict (both changed): neither overwritten, logged to hubspot_sync_log with both values
- `GET /hubspot/conflicts` + `POST /hubspot/conflicts/resolve` for manual review

Frontend (src/App.jsx):
- OAuth callback handler on `/oauth/callback?code=` with loading/success/error states
- HubSpot Integration panel in admin Configuration screen: connection status badge, Sync Now button
- CloudFront custom error responses (403/404 → index.html) for SPA routing

Infrastructure deployed:
- Lambda: `xo-hubspot-sync` (eu-west-2, role xo-lambda-role, 256MB, 60s)
- Env vars: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, AES_MASTER_KEY, AES_ENCRYPTION_KEY, BUCKET_NAME, HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_TOKEN, HUBSPOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET, HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID, HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET
- API Gateway: 10 resources under /hubspot/* on xo-api (odvopohlp3), deployed to prod
- DB migrations: hubspot_company_id, hubspot_contact_id, hubspot_last_sync on clients/partners; hubspot_sync_log table
- JWT secret rotated across all 9 xo- Lambda functions (64-char)
- RDS master password rotated (32-char)
- CloudFront SPA routing configured (E7PWZX8BT02CE)

Testing: 50 pytest regression tests covering Private App auth, sync push/pull, field mapping, dedup with URL normalization, timestamp-based conflict resolution, webhook auth, pull-only mode

Verified: Full sync pushed 2 partners + 12 clients, pulled 13 back. Webhook pull-only sync operational.

**Next Step:** Web enrichment (company website + LinkedIn research), UI for 5 new DB fields (survival metrics, AI persona, strategic objective, tone mode).
